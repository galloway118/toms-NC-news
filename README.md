# Toms NC news front End Project

## Background

This is a app, demonstrating the front end of my NC news project. The app communicates with a back end project I also created. Links to both projects can be found below. 

The app allows you to filter and sort articles, interact with articles viewing comments, liking and deleting comments.

In order to delete comments, you must be logged in, you can do this by using the default user tickle122 (you are logged in by default, but you can log out by clicking on the user button in the top left hand corner in desktop mode, in mobile mode you need to click on the user tab in the sidebar).

## Setting up your own repository

The backend repository can also be cloned at:
